# Technology Stack

## Architecture

[High-level system design approach]

## Core Technologies

- **Language**: [e.g., TypeScript, Python]
- **Framework**: [e.g., React, Next.js, Django]
- **Runtime**: [e.g., Node.js 20+]

## Key Libraries

[Only major libraries that influence development patterns]

## Development Standards

### Type Safety
[e.g., TypeScript strict mode, no `any`]

### Code Quality
[e.g., ESLint, Prettier rules]

### Testing
[e.g., Jest, coverage requirements]

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
[Key tools and version requirements]

### Common Commands
```bash
# Dev: [command]
# Build: [command]
# Test: [command]
```

## Key Technical Decisions

[Important architectural choices and rationale]
